# Car Insurance -- QueryableState (modified)

This is a modified version of the [corda/samples-kotlin/Features/queryableState](https://github.com/corda/samples-kotlin/tree/master/Features/queryableState-carinsurance) 
that shows how to use the `and()` predicative in a composite QueryCriteria ([Utilities.kt](https://github.com/alebaffa/corda-custom-query-tests/blob/master/workflows/src/main/kotlin/net/corda/samples/carinsurance/flows/Utilities.kt)).
